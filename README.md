```lrc
[00:12.26] How long do ya' think it'll take
[00:13.41] How much work should I put in
[00:14.46] How much more time
[00:15.24] 'Til I'm not considered a fake
[00:16.42] Clock keeps ticking along
[00:17.44] When did I go so wrong?
[00:18.30] They say time heals all wounds
[00:19.51] Yeah right I think it fuels all my seething hate
[00:21.41] Is this my twisted fate?
[00:22.56] How much longer can I last
[00:23.61] 'Til I crumble and brake
[00:24.53] Gears need to start turning now
[00:25.63] Stuck
[00:26.04] I can't even think of how
[00:27.16] Fuck
[00:27.55] Fighting for my life
[00:28.21] Wonder if its ever enough
[00:29.22] While work is piling up
[00:30.23] Yuh
[00:30.65] Broken clock right twice a day
[00:31.67] Wrong
[00:32.09] Try to stay in the right time
[00:33.28] Zone
[00:33.70] I don't think I want anymore of this
[00:35.09] But my deadline is approaching fast
[00:36.09] I don't have too long
[00:36.74] Our time keeps on feeling like
[00:38.84] It's running out fine
[00:41.14] I know just how to stay in line
[00:42.83] Caffeinated drugs
[00:43.73] Wait hold on what I meant to say was a little love
[00:45.90] Some much needed discipline
[00:47.13] So we can chase the clout that's making us rot
[00:48.94] So high
[00:50.25] The adrenaline building up
[00:52.03] Override
[00:53.35] Where can we even draw the line
[00:55.02] Can you make it stop
[00:55.95] Sit back relax
[00:56.78] It'll be fine
[00:57.48] Just give it some time
[00:58.23] Fight intrusive thoughts
[00:59.02] Just keep on soldiering on til you slip and fall
[01:01.13] Tick Tock, Tick Tock, Tick Tock, Tick Tock
[01:04.15] Make it stop, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop
[01:05.73] Make it stop before I short out from overclock
[01:07.19] Can't ever slow down
[01:08.18] Lock in if I want to make it to the top
[01:10.34] Don't even know how
[01:11.23] I keep pushing my limit it's getting hot
[01:13.39] Its gonna work out
[01:14.24] Keep on going
[01:14.83] Wont be stopping til I drop
[01:16.40] I'm getting burnt out
[01:17.28] Overworking
[01:17.97] What's that sharp pain
[01:18.74] Make it stop
[01:25.64] How long do ya think it'll take
[01:26.50] How much more work should I put in
[01:27.23] How much more time 'til I'm not a faker
[01:28.08] Not an imitation
[01:28.67] When will the clock stop ticking
[01:29.58] All alone
[01:29.88] Oh sometimes I wonder when ever did I go so wrong
[01:31.78] They say that time heals all wounds
[01:32.47] Yeah right
[01:32.69] I think it fuels all my burning rage
[01:33.40] Is this my twisted fate
[01:34.12] Is it all just a big mistake
[01:34.80] How much longer can I last in this fractured state
[01:36.31] Will I lose all progress when I crumble and brake
[01:37.89] Gears need to start turning stuck
[01:38.59] I can't even think of how fuck
[01:39.39] Fighting for my life wonder if its ever going to be enough
[01:40.80] All of the trials are so mesmerizing
[01:42.12] What
[01:42.39] I got distracted while the tasks were piling up
[01:43.93] The broken clock is right twice a day but maybe that's all wrong
[01:45.19] I don't really even know
[01:45.63] I'm trying to stay in the right time zone
[01:46.95] Don't think I want any more of this
[01:48.35] But my deadline is approaching fast so I don't have too long
[02:08.03] Relax, inhale, take your time
[02:11.06] Breath out, just try to rest for a while
[02:14.15] Feelings that you may disguise
[02:17.18] Don't let them pass you by
[02:20.28] Even if you have your doubts
[02:23.33] That's fine, just let it work itself out
[02:26.35] No point in losing your head now
[02:29.44] No shame in slowing down
[02:32.54] Relax, inhale, take my time
[02:35.57] Breath out, just try to enjoy my life
[02:38.62] Feelings that I may disguise
[02:41.72] Won't let them pass me by
[02:44.73] Even if I have my doubts
[02:47.77] That's fine, I'll let it work itself out
[02:50.85] No point in losing my head now
[02:53.95] No shame in slowing down
